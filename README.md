This is a Unit modding Editor for Dynasty Warriors 3, Dynasty Warriors 3 Xtreme Legends, and Dynasty Warriors 3 Xtreme Legends merged iso. It works for all regions of the games. Credit goes to God(Christian), Michael for documentation on Dynasty Warriors 3's unit data, and myself for the programming. To use the script or executable place it in the same directory as your DW3 game. Make sure to rename the game's iso file to "DW3.iso" and place the icon files in the Icon_Files folder.

You need Python installed to use the pyw file but the executable is a standalone script that doesn't require Python installed.
